i) Vague roadmap for C2-Ray mod.

- Create visualisation pipeline. DONE.
- Remove OpenMP looping. DONE. Pushed 2014/01/02
- Read SourceList on node = 0 and only distribute sources to their relevant nodes. DONE
- Read density field on each node and store only local density on each node. NOT DONE (still using test version so no need as of yet).
- Alter MPI to be node domoain decomposed rather than master slave. DONE.
- Only calculate ionisation in MPI node a source resides in. DONE. But ionising fractions are not calculated globally at the moment...
- Setup relevant data structures to aggregate ionisation info on borders between MPI nodes. NOT DONE.
- Communicate data across boundaries and proceed with reionisation in a one-node shell around original source node. NOT DONE.
- Re-implement threading. Not sure how at this stage. NOT DONE.
