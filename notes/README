This version of c2ray contains a build (C2Ray_3D_test_periodic_mpi) with a new domain decomposition. This is still a work in progress. Currently the code now works in a domain decomposition (cartesian as per the cubep3m code) wherein the reionisation is calculated in each individual domain from sources that are only in the relevent domain. The sources are read in on the master task (which task this is can be set in the parameters - but it is recommended that task = 0 is used) and distributed to their target domains. The reionisation currently does not proceed past the boundaries between the domains. The various outputs are written individually by each task (substantially increasing the number of output files!).
